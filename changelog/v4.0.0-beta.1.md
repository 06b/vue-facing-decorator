# Output into new dist structure

* Output ESM into dist/esm
* Output CommonJS into dist/cjs

If you use deprecated `vue-facing-decorator/dist/index-return-cons` and your ts config uses `moduleResolution` with `Node16`, it will be resolved correctly. Otherwise you need to change the path to `vue-facing-decorator/dist/esm/index-return-cons` or `vue-facing-decorator/dist/cjs/index-return-cons`.

# Totally remove support for initialization class fields with this.xxx in class declaration

```ts
@Component
class C extends Vue{
    @Prop
    prop!:string

    method(){return ''}

    field1 = this.prop //NOT SUPPORT

    field2 = this.method()  //NOT SUPPORT
}
```
